# Algorithms Visualizer
 This project implements and visualizes two algorithms:  Closest Pair Algorithm (Divide-and-Conquer Approach). Integer Multiplication Algorithm (Karatsuba's Method). Features: Interactive Web Application: Built with Flask, it allows users to upload input files, select algorithms, and view results. Algorithm Implementation: Python-based backend for efficient algorithm execution. Visualization: Matplotlib-powered visual representations of algorithm steps.
